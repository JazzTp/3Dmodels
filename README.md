# 3Dmodels
3D models for the **FlightGear** aircraft **JA37 Viggen** and also 3D models for other purposes.


Items with no license.txt document are by default under **GNU GPLv2**, [GNU General Public License] (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html) version 2 at the moment (2015 August 5th),
and will automatically implicitly switch to whatever public domain license the FlightGear simulator http://flightgear.org/ will have switched to, for compatibility with
distribution with FlightGear.

Apart minor changes to some of the cockpit instruments of Nikolai's Viggen model, I have the honour to also have made the current cockpit lateral panels, but I won't put them
in this repository because they are strictly tailored to the fuselage of the destination aircraft...

... which BTW I don't stop recommending because Nikolai made a *great* FDM for it and he's constantly improving all aspects of the aircraft.
