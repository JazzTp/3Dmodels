3D models for FlightGear aircraft JA37 Viggen and other purposes

(Certain items are so specific to Nikolai's JA37 Viggen that I won't put them in this repository, maybe I'll only add screenshots.
It is the case of the cockpit lateral panels, the base and extensions ones, which are strictly tailored to the fuselage of the destination aircraft.)
