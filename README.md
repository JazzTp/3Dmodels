# 3Dmodels
3D models for the FlightGear aircraft JA37 Viggen git@github.com:NikolaiVChr/flightgear-saab-ja-37-viggen.git
and also 3D models for other purposes.

Items with no license.txt document are currently (2015-vii-4) by default under the GNU General Public License, version 2 (GNU GPLv2) http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html
and will automatically implicitly switch to whatever public domain license the FlightGear simulator http://flightgear.org/ will have switched to, for compatibility with
distribution with FlightGear.

Apart minor changes to some of the cockpit instruments of Nikolai's Viggen model, I have the honour to also have made the current cockpit lateral panels, but I won't put them
in this repository because they are strictly tailored to the fuselage of the destination aircraft...

... which BTW I don't stop recommending because Nikolai made a great FDM for it and he's constantly improving systems and 3D modelling:
