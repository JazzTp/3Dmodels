Apart minor changes to some of the cockpit instruments of Nikolai's Viggen model, I have the honor to also have made the current cockpit lateral panels, but I won't put them in this repository because they are strictly tailored to the fuselage of the destination aircraft...

... which BTW I don't stop recommending because Nikolai made a *great* FDM for it and he's constantly improving all aspects of the aircraft.
