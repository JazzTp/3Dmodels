# 3Dmodels
3D models for the [FlightGear] (http://www.flightgear.org/) aircraft [JA37 Viggen] (https://github.com/NikolaiVChr) and also 3D models for other purposes.

Items with no license.txt document are currently (2015-vii-4) by default under the GNU General Public License, version 2 (GNU GPLv2) http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html
and will automatically implicitly switch to whatever public domain license the FlightGear simulator http://flightgear.org/ will have switched to, for compatibility with
distribution with FlightGear.

Apart minor changes to some of the cockpit instruments of Nikolai's Viggen model, I have the honour to also have made the current cockpit lateral panels, but I won't put them
in this repository because they are strictly tailored to the fuselage of the destination aircraft...

... which BTW I don't stop recommending because Nikolai made a *great* FDM for it and he's constantly improving all aspects of the aircraft.
