This knob can be used with low height above a panel or it can be located crossing a panel (should look like if there was a hole in the panel for it, or the aperture can actually be made, circular or cylindric) and barely extend above it.

The idea is probably suitable for plastic injection, or aluminium fusion, or 3D printing.
Actually I modelled this one after seeing the real thing in an electro-mechanical appliance, made in semi transparent plastic (I believe the same exists in metal too).
(EDIT: just saw another similar one but with spheric "cuts" where this one has cilyndric or planar "cuts".)

For use in a game or simulator, this model has too few polygons on one part and too many on the other, this was just a test, I plan to remodel it.
